README FILE FOR SSIS-DEMO03 PROJECT

This project uses the project deployment model to perform DB CRUD operations based on an Excel file

Using Visual Studio 2017 with SQL Server 2017.
NOTE: VS is having trouble* with Excel 2016 (.xlsx), so I had to use Excel 2003 format (.xls)
      The trouble was the Connection Manager (in the Excel Source Editor) would not find Sheet1$, so as a
      quick workaround, I used 2003 format.
